My final project took quite a different direction than the one it was initally heading towards. Initially, I wanted to expound on my third project with the orbiting three dimensional shapes.
The longer I worked on it, I began to realize more and more that the concept was quickly becoming a rehash of what I did for project three. Thus, I decided to instead create a cityscape.
Though not as dense and ornately detailed as I hoped, Night City serves as my final project. In the menu, you are able to click and see the menus for each of the restaurants in the city.
